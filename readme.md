# 2048 Game 

This is an implementation of the 2048 game using Python and the Pygame module.

## Gameplay

- Use the arrow keys to move all the tiles
- When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one tile with double the number  
- A new tile with the number 2 or 4 will be generated in an empty spot after each move
- The goal is to create higher numbered tiles, with the ultimate goal of reaching 2048
- The game ends when there are no valid moves left
